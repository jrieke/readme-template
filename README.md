## Installation

```bash
pip install sample-package
```

You can add some more detailed instructions here. Don't forget to mention any special dependencies.


## How to use it

```python
import sample_package

sample_package.do_something()
sample_package.do_something_else()
```

Add some description of what will happen. Or an image. Or the terminal output of the command above. One to three paragraphs of text is a good guideline here. Ideally, the user should be able to run a simple example with this instruction. Anything more advanced can go to the section below. 


## More options

- Here's something else you can do:

  ```python
  sample_package.super_advanced_func()
  ```

- Also, there's feature X. 

- If you already have a lot of features, you can split this up into several sections.
